OHHH, SHOW US YOUR MUSCLES! YOU'LL BE A SOLDIER!
THERE'S A WAR COMING, NED. I DON'T KNOW WHEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO WE'LL BE FIGHTING...BUT IT'S COMING!
SURROUNDED BY LANNISTERS! EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES I SEE THEIR BLONDE HAIR AND THEIR SMUG, SATISFIED FACES!
IT MUST WOUND YOUR PRIDE! STANDING OUT THERE, LIKE A GLORIFIED SENTRY!
HE COULD HAVE LINGERED ON THE EDGE OF THE BATTLE WITH THE SMART BOYS, AND TODAY HIS WIFE WOULD BE MAKING HIM MISERABLE, HIS SONS WOULD BE INGRATES, AND HE WOULD BE WAKING THREE TIMES IN THE NIGHT TO PISS INTO A BOWL!
PISS ON THAT! SEND A RAVEN! I WANT YOU TO STAY! I'M THE KING, I GET WHAT I WANT!
HOLD YOUR TONGUE!
WHO NAMED YOU? SOME HALFWIT WITH A STUTTER??
WINE! WINE! MOOOOOOOOAR WINE!
SOON ENOUGH, THAT CHILD WILL SPREAD HER LEGS AND START BREEDING!
WE'RE TELLING WAR STORIES! WHO WAS YOUR FIRST KILL, NOT COUNTING OLD MEN?
THANK THE GODS FOR BESSIE AND HER TITS
WHY HAVE I NOT SEEN YOU? WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?
WHO NAMED YOU? SOME HALFWIT WITH A STUTTER??
IS THAT WHAT EMPTY MEANS??
YOU'RE THE KING'S HAND! YOU'LL DO AS I COMMAND, OR I'LL FIND ME A HAND WHO WILL!
THEY NEVER TELL YOU HOW THEY ALL SHIT THEMSELVES! THEY DON'T PUT THAT PART IN THE SONGS!
STOP THIS MADNESS, IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING!
CAREFUL, NED! CAREFUL NOW!
OUT! OUT, DAMN YOU! I'M DONE WITH YOU! GO, RUN BACK TO WINTERFELL! I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD ON A SPIKE!
I'VE GOT SEVEN KINGDOMS TO RULE! ONE KING, SEVEN KINGDOMS!
OH, IT'S UNSPEAKABLE TO YOU? WHAT HER FATHER DID TO YOUR FAMILY, THAT WAS UNSPEAKABLE!
WEAR IT IN SILENCE, OR I'LL HONOR YOU AGAIN!
WINE! WINE! MOOOOOOOOAR WINE!
STUPID BOY!
CAREFUL, NED! CAREFUL NOW!
FORCED TO MIND THE DOOR WHILE YOUR KING EATS AND DRINKS AND SHITS AND FUCKS!
OUT! OUT, DAMN YOU! I'M DONE WITH YOU! GO, RUN BACK TO WINTERFELL! I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD ON A SPIKE!
I WARNED YOU THIS WOULD HAPPEN! BACK IN THE NORTH, I WARNED YOU, BUT YOU DIDN'T CARE TO HEAR! WELL, HEAR IT NOW!
EASY, BOY! YOU MIGHT BE MY BROTHER BUT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO THE KING!
A DOTHRAKI HORDE ON AN OPEN FIELD, NED!
START THE DAMN JOUST BEFORE I PISS MESELF!
SHE SHOULD BE ON A HILL SOMEWHERE WITH THE SUN AND THE CLOUDS ABOVE HER!
COME, BOW BEFORE YOUR KING! BOW, YA SHITS!
START THE DAMN JOUST BEFORE I PISS MESELF!
STUPID BOY!
YOU'RE MY COUNCIL, COUNSEL! SPEAK SENSE TO THIS HONORABLE FOOL!
OUT! OUT, DAMN YOU! I'M DONE WITH YOU! GO, RUN BACK TO WINTERFELL! I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD ON A SPIKE!
SHE BELONGED WITH ME!
IS THAT HOW YOU SPEAK TO YOUR KING??
THERE'S A WAR COMING, NED. I DON'T KNOW WHEN, I DON'T KNOW WHO WE'LL BE FIGHTING...BUT IT'S COMING!
STOP THIS MADNESS, IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING!
YOUR MOTHER WAS A DUMB WHORE WITH A FAT ARSE, DID YOU KNOW THAT?
GODS WHAT A STUPID NAME!
YOU EVER FUCK A RIVERLANDS GIRL?
CAREFUL, NED! CAREFUL NOW!
YOU GOT FAT!
DO YOU THINK IT'S HONOR THAT'S KEEPING THE PEACE?! IT'S FEAR! FEAR AND BLOOD!
HOLD YOUR TONGUE!
